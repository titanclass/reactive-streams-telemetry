Welcome to reactive-streams-telemetry!

The goal of this [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)/Java library is to provide a [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) interface to [Open Telemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java) metrics and traces so that low memory utilization can be attained.

Metrics and traces are presented using streams where elements pertain to Open Telemetry's [MetricData](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/metrics/data/MetricData.java)
and [SpanData](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/trace/data/SpanData.java) classes respectively. 
Applications can consume these streams and present them 
however they wish e.g. [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/) can be used to serve a snapshot of metrics and traces as JSON
with an HTTP `GET` route. Another example could be where metrics and traces are published
over UDP to your favorite collection engine.

[Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/stream/)
is used as the Reactive Streams interface and implementation.

Other than the libraries declared above, there are no additional dependencies.

## Teaser

Serve up the latest telemetry gathered given an [Alpakka Unix Domain Socket](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/unix-domain-socket.html) 
and the establishment of the `metrics` and `traces` sources from their respective exporters:

```scala
import akka.NotUsed
import akka.stream.alpakka.unixdomainsocket.scaladsl.UnixDomainSocket
import akka.stream.scaladsl.{ Flow, Sink, Source }
import au.com.titanclass.streams.telemetry.{ MetricProtobufMarshalling, SpanProtobufMarshalling }
import io.opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.data.MetricData
import io.opentelemetry.sdk.trace.data.SpanData
import java.io.File

val metrics: Source[MetricData, NotUsed] = ???
val traces: Source[SpanData, NotUsed] = ???

val source =
  metrics
    .map { metricData =>
      import MetricProtobufMarshalling._
      metricData.toProtobuf.build().toString
    }
    .merge(
      traces
        .map { spanData =>
          import SpanProtobufMarshalling._
          spanData.toProtobuf.build().toString
        }
    )

UnixDomainSocket()
  .bindAndHandle(Flow.fromSinkAndSourceCoupled(Sink.ignore, source),
                 new File("/var/run/mysocket.sock"))
```

The above will just output the string representations of each element of telemetry.
